      <h2>It started on someone's knees.</h2>
      <p>
        Not on a desk. Not in a lab. But on the knees of a tired traveler in a
        cramped airplane seat. Of a writer in a quiet café. Of a dreamer in
        search of comfort, control, and freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world changed, but keyboards didn’t. They stayed bulky. Rigid.
        Designed for desks, not for life.
      </p>

          around?</strong

      <h2>So we made one.</h2>
      <p>
        Keybe Bee™ is a new kind of keyboard. It’s soft. It’s silent. It’s ready
        to travel. And right in the middle, where it belongs, lives the heart of
        control: a trackpad.
      </p>

      <p>
        It folds. It breathes. It works on your lap — because that’s where you
        live.
      </p>
