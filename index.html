    <h1>Keybe Bee™</h1>
    <p>
      Portable. Ergonomic. Beautiful.<br />The keyboard you want to carry with
      you.
    </p>

    <h2>It started on someone's knees.</h2>
    <p>
      Not on a desk. Not in a lab. But on the knees of a tired traveler in a
      cramped airplane seat. Of a writer in a quiet café. Of a dreamer in search
      of comfort, control, and freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world changed, but keyboards didn’t. They stayed bulky. Rigid.
      Designed for desks, not for life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We asked a simple question:
      <strong
        >What if a keyboard was made to follow you — not the other way
        around?</strong
      >
    </p>

    <h2>So we made one.</h2>
    <p>
      Keybe Bee™ is a new kind of keyboard. It's soft. It's silent. It's ready
      to travel. And right in the middle, where it belongs, lives the heart of
      control: a trackpad.
    </p>

    <p>
      It folds. It breathes. It works on your lap — because that's where you
      live.
    </p>
