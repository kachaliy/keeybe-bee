    <h1>Keybe Bee‚Ñ¢</h1>
    <p>The keyboard made to move with you.</p>

    <h2>It started on someone's knees.</h2>
    <p>
      Not on a desk. Not in a lab.<br />
      But on the knees of a tired traveler in a cramped airplane seat.<br />
      Of a writer in a quiet caf√©.<br />
      Of a dreamer in search of comfort, control, and freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world changed, but keyboards didn‚Äôt.<br />
      They stayed bulky. Rigid. Designed for desks, not for life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We asked a simple question:<br />
      <strong
        >What if a keyboard was made to follow you ‚Äî not the other way
        around?</strong
      >
    </p>

    <h2>So we made one.</h2>
    <p>
      Keybe Bee‚Ñ¢ is a new kind of keyboard.<br />
      It's soft. It's silent. It's ready to travel.<br />
      And right in the middle, where it belongs,<br />
      lives the heart of control: a trackpad.
    </p>

    <p>
      It folds. It breathes. It works on your lap ‚Äî<br />
      because that's where you live.
    </p>

    <h2>Join the swarm.</h2>

      Bee first to know. Bee part of the revolution. üêù<br />
