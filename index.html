      <h1>Keybe Bee™</h1>
      <p>The keyboard made to move with you.</p>

      <h2>It didn't start at a desk.</h2>
      <p>
        It started with a hum. A buzz. A question.<br />
        What if a keyboard was made to <strong>bee</strong> with you — not
        behind you?
      </p>

      <p>
        Not in a lab. Not on a desk.<br />
        But on the knees of a tired traveler in a cramped airplane seat.<br />
        Of a writer in a quiet café. A coder on a couch.<br />
        Of a dreamer tired of reaching too far.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world got lighter, faster, freer —<br />
        but keyboards stayed heavy, stuck, still.<br />
        Rigid. Flat. Desks-only. Life-denying.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we made something else.<br />
        Something that folds. That flows. That follows you.
      </p>

      <h2>We made Keybe Bee™</h2>
      <p>
        A keyboard that knows your lap.<br />
        That rests like wings.<br />
        That hums with motion — and ends with control.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right in the center — where your thumbs naturally rest —<br />
        lives the brain of the bee: <strong>a precision trackpad.</strong><br />
        No reaching. No awkward side swipes. No external mouse.<br />
        Just pure control. Instinctive. Effortless. Beautiful.<br />
        <em>Steve Jobs would have nodded.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s soft. It’s silent. It’s ready to travel.<br />
        And more than anything — it just makes sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        It folds. It breathes. It works on your lap —<br />
        because that’s where you live.
      </p>

      <h2>Join the swarm.</h2>
      <p>
        Bee first to know. Bee part of the revolution. 🐝<br />
