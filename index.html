      <h1>The keyboard made to move with you.</h1>
      <p>No desk. No limits. Just you and control under your fingertips.</p>

      <h2>It started on someone's knees.</h2>
      <p>
        Not on a desk. Not in a lab. But on the knees of a tired traveler in a
        cramped airplane seat. Of a writer in a quiet caf√©. Of a dreamer in
        search of comfort, control, and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world changed, but keyboards didn‚Äôt. They stayed bulky. Rigid.
        Designed for desks, not for life.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        <strong
          >What if a keyboard was made to follow you ‚Äî not the other way
          around?</strong

      <h2>So we made one.</h2>
      <p>
        Keybe Bee‚Ñ¢ is a new kind of keyboard. It's soft. It's silent. It's ready
        to travel. And right in the middle, where it belongs, lives the heart of
        control: a trackpad.
      </p>
      <p>
        It folds. It breathes. It works on your lap ‚Äî because that‚Äôs where you
        live.
      </p>
